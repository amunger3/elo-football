To install:

* Clone Repo
* setup python virtual environment and start it, then install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv env
env/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now just `python run.py` to build the json and write it.

## Documentation

Most of these files are deprecated. Season is suspended anyhow.
